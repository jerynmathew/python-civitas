# Civitas

**The production runtime for Python agents.**

---

## Why Civitas?

*Civitas* is the Latin word for city-state — the community of citizens bound by
shared laws, common purpose, and mutual protection.

The root is *civis* (citizen). It gives English: civilization, civic, civil, citizen.
A civitas wasn't just a place — it was a self-governing body that conferred rights,
identity, and protection on those who belonged to it.

Before Civitas, agents were isolated processes: no persistent identity, no rights,
no protection. If one crashed, nothing noticed. Nothing restarted it.

Civitas is the covenant that changes what they are.
It gives agents citizenship: a runtime that watches over them, restarts them on failure,
routes messages between them, and traces every action — automatically.

---

Civitas is an OTP-inspired agent runtime for Python. It gives your agent systems the infrastructure layer they need to run reliably in production: supervised processes that restart automatically on failure, transport-agnostic message passing that scales from a script to a distributed cluster, and zero-instrumentation observability via OpenTelemetry.

```bash
pip install civitas
```

---

## What Civitas is — and isn't

Civitas is a **runtime**, not a framework. Frameworks like LangGraph, CrewAI, and the OpenAI Agents SDK define *how* you build agents. Civitas defines *how they stay alive*.

It sits at the bottom of the agent stack:

```
Context layer    →  prompts, memory, RAG
Control layer    →  guardrails, HITL gates, cost limits
Runtime layer    →  Civitas: lifecycle, fault tolerance, routing, observability
```

You can run Civitas alongside any of those frameworks. The [LangGraph adapter](adapters.md) wraps a compiled graph as a Civitas process in three lines.

## When to use Civitas

Civitas is a good fit when you need any of the following:

- **Fault tolerance** — agents that crash should restart automatically, with configurable strategies and backoff
- **Multi-agent systems** — multiple agents communicating via message passing, with named routing and backpressure
- **Scaling without rewrites** — the same agent code should run in a single process during development and across machines in production
- **Production observability** — every message, LLM call, and tool invocation traced to OTEL automatically

If you are building a simple, single-agent script that calls an LLM and exits, Civitas adds more structure than you need. Start with the Anthropic SDK or OpenAI SDK directly.

## Five-minute start

**Hello agent** — no LLM, no dependencies beyond the core install:

```python
import asyncio
from civitas import AgentProcess, Runtime, Supervisor
from civitas.messages import Message

class Echo(AgentProcess):
    async def handle(self, message: Message) -> Message | None:
        return self.reply({"echo": message.payload["text"]})

async def main():
    runtime = Runtime(supervisor=Supervisor("root", children=[Echo("echo")]))
    await runtime.start()
    result = await runtime.ask("echo", {"text": "hello"})
    print(result.payload["echo"])   # hello
    await runtime.stop()

asyncio.run(main())
```

**With supervision** — agent crashes randomly, supervisor restarts it, callers never see it:

```python
import asyncio, random
from civitas import AgentProcess, Runtime, Supervisor
from civitas.messages import Message

class Flaky(AgentProcess):
    async def handle(self, message: Message) -> Message | None:
        if random.random() < 0.5:
            raise RuntimeError("temporary failure")
        return self.reply({"ok": True})

async def main():
    runtime = Runtime(
        supervisor=Supervisor(
            "root",
            strategy="ONE_FOR_ONE",
            max_restarts=10,
            backoff="EXPONENTIAL",
            children=[Flaky("flaky")],
        )
    )
    await runtime.start()
    for _ in range(5):
        result = await runtime.ask("flaky", {})
        print(result.payload)   # always succeeds
    await runtime.stop()

asyncio.run(main())
```

**With an LLM** — install the Anthropic provider and inject it via `Runtime`:

```bash
pip install civitas[anthropic]
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-...
```

```python
from civitas import AgentProcess, Runtime, Supervisor
from civitas.messages import Message
from civitas.plugins.anthropic import AnthropicProvider

class Assistant(AgentProcess):
    async def handle(self, message: Message) -> Message | None:
        response = await self.llm.chat(
            model="claude-haiku-4-5",
            messages=[{"role": "user", "content": message.payload["question"]}],
        )
        return self.reply({"answer": response.content})

runtime = Runtime(
    supervisor=Supervisor("root", children=[Assistant("assistant")]),
    model_provider=AnthropicProvider(),
)
```
